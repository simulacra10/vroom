**The Parent’s Guide to Coaching a Teen Behind the Wheel**
*Tips for Being Calm, Safe, and Effective During Practice Drives*

Teaching your teen to drive is one of the most rewarding — and nerve-wracking — milestones of parenthood. You're not just handing over the keys; you're guiding them toward independence and responsibility. Whether you're a seasoned driver or still flinch at every lane change, your role as a coach can make all the difference in your teen’s driving success and safety.

Here’s how to keep things calm, safe, and productive as you take the passenger seat.

---

### 1. **Start in a Safe, Quiet Place**

Choose an empty parking lot or a quiet residential neighborhood for the first few lessons. Let your teen get used to basic functions — steering, braking, accelerating, signaling — without traffic pressure. Build confidence before moving into more complex environments.

### 2. **Stay Calm — Even When You’re Not**

Your teen will make mistakes. Expect them. What matters is how *you* respond. Keep your voice calm and steady. Avoid yelling or gasping — it can startle your teen and cause panic. If you need to correct something urgently, do so clearly and firmly, then talk it over afterward.

---

### 3. **Be Clear and Specific**

“Turn here” is vague. “In 200 feet, turn right at the stop sign” is better. Teens are still learning how to process driving cues while staying aware of surroundings. Simple, precise instructions help them stay focused and confident.

---

### 4. **Give Feedback — Gently**

Praise what they do well before pointing out mistakes. For example:
“Nice job keeping a steady speed. Let’s work on smoother stops next time.”
This encourages growth without discouraging effort.

### 5. **Plan Each Drive With a Goal**

Have a learning objective for each session — whether it's merging onto a highway, parallel parking, or navigating busy intersections. This structure helps you stay on track and ensures your teen is steadily building skills.


---

### 6. **Teach Defensive Driving Habits**

Point out potential hazards early — pedestrians near the road, brake lights ahead, or cars edging out of driveways. Help your teen develop the habit of scanning the road and anticipating problems before they happen.

---

### 7. **Model Good Driving Behavior**

Your teen has watched you drive for years. Now they're noticing everything — your habits, good or bad. Set the example: no texting, full stops at signs, using turn signals, and staying within the speed limit.

---

### 8. **Use Downtime for Discussion**

Some of the best teaching moments happen *after* the drive. Review what went well and what could improve. Ask your teen how they felt and what they noticed. This opens communication and helps them think critically about their driving.

### 9. **Know When to Switch Seats**

If your teen becomes overwhelmed or the driving conditions become too challenging (heavy traffic, bad weather, etc.), it’s okay to pull over and take the wheel. Pushing too hard can erode confidence.



---

### 10. **Be Patient — With Them and Yourself**

Learning to drive is a process. There will be setbacks, close calls, and maybe even a few tears. Stay committed to the long game. Your calm guidance is helping shape a safe, capable, and independent driver. 



---

### Final Thought

Behind the wheel, you’re more than a parent — you’re a mentor, coach, and sometimes a co-pilot holding your breath. But with steady nerves and a thoughtful approach, you can turn practice drives into a shared journey that builds trust, confidence, and life-long safety skills.
